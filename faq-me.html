					<p>.ME is an IDN domain as of 2018. A domain name that is an IDN (internationalized domains) can have ASCII alphanumeric characters and hyphens, as well as all other characters. You can register your .ME domain in the following languages and scripts: Arabic, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese (traditional and simplified), Croatian, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Montenegrin (Latin and Cyrillic), Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian (Latin and Cyrillic), Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian.</p>

					<p>The maximum length of a domain name is 63 characters, including the dot and the domain extension. So, if you are lucky to have a domain like me.ME you have a 5 character domain. Many people would refer to "me.ME" as a two-letter domain, however, it's important for you to know that the ".ME" part counts as well, so actually, this domain has 5 characters. The complete URL length may not exceed 253 characters.</p>

					<p>While our policies were always anti-abuse oriented, in 2016 we decided to establish an anti-abuse team, together with our back-end provider and partner Afilias and start to act proactively to ensure the safety and security of .ME neighborhood! This includes daily monitoring for spam, phishing, malware, pharming, fast flux hosting, illegal access to other computers or networks, distribution of child pornography, gathering domains by misuse of WHOIS information, but also sinkholing domains found to be a threat as botnets, and other forms of abuse.

					<p>If you do not renew the domain name it will expire and eventually get back to the pool of available domains. For instance, after a .ME domain expires it is automatically auto-renewed (provided that the sponsoring registrar allows for an auto-renew period) and the domain holder can continue to use it after paying a renewal fee. If the holder does not renew it, the subject .ME domain will be deleted and it will enter a 30-day redemption grace period. During this period the domain holder may redeem the domain but for a higher price (prices are set by the sponsoring registrar). If the subject .ME domain is not redeemed it will enter a 5-day redemption grace period when no changes could be made to the domain. After the redemption grace period a .ME domain becomes available for public registration.</p>

					<p>You can register a .ME domain only through a .ME accredited registrar or their reseller. Any company can become an accredited .ME Registrar. This can be completed in three easy steps:</p>
                        <ul class="list1">
							<li><b>Step 1: Apply</b><br>
								If the registrar already has an ORMS account (Afilias Online Registrar Management System) they can login here: <a href="https://apply.afilias.info/." target="blank">https://apply.afilias.info/</a>. If they do not have an ORMS account they may send us their company information and we will open it for them.<br>
								As for the rest of the documentation, in the ORMS the registrar will find two forms that need to be filled in. The Data Form asks for contact information of the registry liaisons and the Finance Form asks for the registrar’s financial information. In addition to the forms we need a company formation document and a signed RRA (Registry-Registrar Agreement).
							</li>
							<li><b>Step 2: Test</b><br>
								After the forms are completed we need to run OT&E (Operational Test and Evaluation) to make sure that the registrar can run domain operations smoothly.
							</li>
							<li><b>Step 3: Production</b><br>
								As soon as the test is successfully completed the registrar is moved to production and contacted by our sales team.
