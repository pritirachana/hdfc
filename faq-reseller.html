					<p>No, we do not charge any kind of Activation or Sign-up Fee. Neither do we have any hidden costs. This is a Zero Investment business for you! We follow an advance pre-payment system. This means that in order to resell, you first need to make an advance deposit in your account with us.<br>
						Every time a purchase is made from your account, the respective funds will be deducted from your account. This advance deposit is fully usable by you, and is not time bound. This means, you can use the entire amount to buy any of our Products at any point of time in future.
